Project "Lab 7 (counter v1)"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project simulates a counter system in Java, consisting of three types of counters: a basic counter, a limited counter, and a rollover counter. The lab demonstrates different counter behaviors and object-oriented design principles.

Classes Overview
  Counter: A basic counter class with methods to increment, decrement, and reset its value.
  LimitedCounter: Extends the Counter class, adding a limit to the counter’s value, ensuring it doesn’t exceed a maximum value.
  RolloverCounter: Extends the Counter class and allows the counter to roll over to zero once it exceeds the specified maximum value.

Features
- Counter: Basic functionality for incrementing, decrementing, and resetting.
- LimitedCounter: Adds a limit to the maximum counter value.
- RolloverCounter: Implements a rollover behavior when the counter exceeds the maximum value.
