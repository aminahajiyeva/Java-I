This repository contains my ongoing Java programming assignments and projects from my second year at Carleton University. The course covers object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, data structures, algorithms, and software design principles. 
Expect to see:
- Class and Object Design
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- File I/O and Exception Handling
- Collections and Data Structures
- Algorithm Implementation

PS. Since this is a work in progress, updates will be added regularly. Feel free to follow along and explore! â˜•
