Project "Lab 8 (counter v2)"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project simulates a counter system in Java, consisting of four classes: a basic counter, a limited counter, a rollover counter, and a test class to verify the functionality of the counters. The lab demonstrates different counter behaviors and object-oriented design principles.

Classes Overview
  Counter: A basic counter class with methods to increment, decrement, and reset its value.
  LimitedCounter: Extends the Counter class, adding a limit to the counter’s value, ensuring it doesn’t exceed a maximum value.
  RolloverCounter: Extends the Counter class and allows the counter to roll over to zero once it exceeds the specified maximum value.
  CounterTest: A test class used to verify the correct functionality of the Counter, LimitedCounter, and RolloverCounter classes.

Features
- Counter: Basic functionality for incrementing, decrementing, and resetting.
- LimitedCounter: Adds a limit to the maximum counter value.
- RolloverCounter: Implements a rollover behavior when the counter exceeds the maximum value.
- CounterTest: Tests the functionality of all three counter classes to ensure they work as expected.
